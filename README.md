# # Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot implemented using TensorFlow and natural language processing techniques. The chatbot is trained to understand and respond to various user queries based on predefined intents.

## Introduction

The chatbot is built using a neural network model that learns from a collection of intents defined in a JSON file. It uses natural language processing techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, and bag-of-words representation, to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.

The chatbot consists of two main components:
1. Training the Model: The `train_chatbot.py` script is used to preprocess the intents data, train the model using ANN, and save the trained model as `chatbot_model.h5`.
2. Running the Chatbot: The `chatbot.py` script is used to load the trained model and interact with the user. It takes user queries as input and generates responses based on the trained model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the NLTK corpus for tokenization:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

## Usage

To use the chatbot, run the `chatbot.py` script:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will load the trained model and start interacting with the user in the command-line interface. Enter your queries and the chatbot will respond accordingly.

## Training

If you want to train the chatbot on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your intents data in a JSON format similar to `intents.json`.

2. Update the file path in the code to point to your intents JSON file.

3. Run the `train_chatbot.py` script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_chatbot.py
   ```

   The script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model as `chatbot_model.h5`.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the chatbot:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- NLTK
